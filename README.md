Evaluating ReAct-Based LLM Reasoning for Korean Date and Schedule Processing

The project investigates whether ReAct-style agentic reasoning (Thought → Action → Observation) improves performance over a strong few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline for Korean temporal reasoning, evaluated across accuracy, latency, and token cost.

📌 Overview

Korean temporal expressions often combine:

Relative references (e.g., “다음 주 금요일”)

Contextual grounding

Compound scheduling constraints
(weekday-only, holiday exclusion, minimum intervals)

We evaluate two reasoning paradigms:

CoT prompting (single-pass, no tools)

ReAct agents (iterative reasoning with tool invocation)

across three temporal reasoning tasks with increasing complexity.

🧠 Tasks

We define three task settings to isolate different dimensions of temporal reasoning:

T1 — Date Normalization (Phrase-level)

Input: Standalone Korean temporal expressions
(e.g., “다음 달 마지막 날 다음 평일”)

Output: Single normalized date (YYYY-MM-DD)

Focus: Temporal arithmetic and boundary reasoning

T2 — Date Normalization with Sentences

Input: Full Korean sentences containing temporal expressions
(e.g., “다음 주 금요일 날짜 알려줘”)

Output: Single normalized date (YYYY-MM-DD)

Focus: Temporal span detection + normalization

T3 — Constraint-based Schedule Generation

Input: Korean scheduling instructions with multiple constraints
(weekday-only, interval rules, holiday exclusion, count limits)

Output: Ordered list of dates (YYYY-MM-DD)

Focus: Multi-event planning, constraint propagation, long-horizon reasoning

🏗️ Methodology
Baseline: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Few-shot prompting with explicit reasoning instructions

Single forward generation

No external tools or validation

Same prompt structure across tasks

ReAct Agent

Iterative Thought → Action → Observation loop

Tool primitives:

calculator — date arithmetic (offsets, intervals, weekdays)

calendar_db — holidays, solar terms, anniversaries

search — external event lookup

Single-step reasoning for T1 / T2

Multi-step planning loop for T3 (max 10 turns)

📊 Models Evaluated
Model	Reasoning
GPT-4.1-mini	CoT / ReAct
SOLAR-pro2 (Upstage)	CoT / ReAct

All experiments use default decoding settings from each API to ensure fair comparison.

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy

T1 / T2: Exact-match accuracy on normalized dates

T3: Full constraint satisfaction (exact list and order)

Efficiency

Latency: Wall-clock time per query

Token usage: Prompt + completion tokens

Failure Conditions

Off-by-one date errors

Constraint violations

ReAct turn-limit collapse

🔍 Key Findings

ReAct significantly improves GPT performance on T1 and T2
(+4–6% accuracy, p < .05), but at very high token cost

Solar-ReAct provides the best cost–performance balance for T1 and T2

All models fail to scale on T3
(≤22% accuracy, no statistical difference between CoT and ReAct)

Tool-driven instability dominates ReAct failures in multi-event reasoning

Ablation replacing hand-coded tools with LLM-driven reasoning
improves T3 accuracy to 31.4%, highlighting that orchestration—not tool availability—is the key factor

⚠️ Limitations

Evaluation relies primarily on accuracy and cost metrics

Reasoning trace quality and failure propagation are not fully analyzed

T1 / T2 are simpler than real-world multi-event scheduling

Tool interfaces are brittle under long-horizon planning

🔮 Future Work

Multi-event temporal pipelines with explicit event segmentation

Adaptive tool-use policies and recovery mechanisms

New metrics for reasoning stability

Broader coverage of Korean temporal phenomena
